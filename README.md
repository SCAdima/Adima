# ADIMA Dataset

Audio files, annotations and code of ADIMA can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1geQ4PlXGsNCvPQDT3tKztvAu817PB5TP).

The annotation folder contains the train and test splits used in our paper for all the languages. Each row of the csv contains the name of audio file and ground-truth indicating the presence of profanity.

For example, “Hindi_train.csv” and “Hindi_test.csv” contains the train and test data for Hindi language. 

Each row of this file has the name of audio file and its label. Labels “Yes” and “No” represent the presence and absence of profanity in the audio file.
