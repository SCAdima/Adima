`python extract_features.py`

Please specify the path to the wav files, dataset splits, destination path and model checkpoint.

Please download the [CLSRIL](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-models) and [XLSR](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec#wav2vec-20) models checkpoints.
